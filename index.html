                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a PhD student at Baylor University studying Electrical Engineering, advised under <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v5Da2gcAAAAJ&hl=en">Professor Keith Schubert</a> in his <a href="https://web.ecs.baylor.edu/faculty/schubert/icthus/">ICThUS Lab</a>. I have six years of work experience in a variety of fields and researching different technologies. Previous experience includes statistical methods in population surveying, computer vision and data compression with remote sensing, and big data analysis in drilling. My passion lies in mathematics and it's various applications, and it is my goal to explore the middle ground of theory and real-world application in medical imaging to improve the world.</p>
